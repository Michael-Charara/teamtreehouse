A relative path is a file path that's relative to your starting location in the file system.
Suppose we want to print the contents of the menu.txt file in the starbunks directory we saw before.
Previously, we changed into the starbunks directory to access the file, but we don't always have to do that. We can do it from another directory.
Let's type our cat command name...
And we know the starbunks directory is within the mall directory. So let's type: mall, and then a slash: mall/...
Then we'll type the name of the starbunks directory, and another slash: starbunks/...
And finally we'll type the name of the file within the starbunks directory: menu.txt
Because you provided a path, the operating system knows how to go from folder to folder to find the file.
treehouse:~/workspace$ cat mall/starbunks/menu.txt
Venti Iced Mocha Soy Latte (with Whip): $29.99
Grande Hot Americano: $34.99
Tall Hot Chocolate: $24.99
By the way, a quick tip - you can use tab completion to do this as well.
Now, let's suppose I was inside the mall directory instead of outside it: cd mall
If I try the same path as before: cat mall/starbunks/menu.txt
...it won't work, because there's no mall directory inside the mall directory.
Instead, I have to adjust the path to account for my starting location, and leave the mall directory off of the path.
If I type starbunks/, and then menu.txt, the operating system will be able to find the file: cat starbunks/menu.txt
And of course, if I'm in the same directory as the file... cd starbunks/
...Then I don't have to provide a path, I can provide just the file name: cat menu.txt
treehouse:~/workspace$ cd mall
treehouse:~/workspace/mall$ cat mall/starbunks/menu.txt
cat: mall/starbunks/menu.txt: No such file or directory
treehouse:~/workspace/mall$ cat starbunks/menu.txt
Venti Iced Mocha Soy Latte (with Whip): $29.99
Grande Hot Americano: $34.99
Tall Hot Chocolate: $24.99
treehouse:~/workspace/mall$ cd starbunks/
treehouse:~/workspace/mall/starbunks$ cat menu.txt
Venti Iced Mocha Soy Latte (with Whip): $29.99
Grande Hot Americano: $34.99
Tall Hot Chocolate: $24.99
Paths work with directories, too.

If you run ls without any arguments, it will list the contents of the current directory.
But if you give it a directory name as an argument, it will list the contents of that directory instead: ls mall
As always, if you want, you can put a slash at the end of a directory name, and it will work the same way: ls mall/
I can join multiple directory names together with slashes:
ls mall/starbunks/
ls mall/dullards/jewelry/
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls mall
dullards  map.txt  starbunks
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls mall/
dullards  map.txt  starbunks
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls mall/starbunks/
menu.txt
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls mall/dullards/jewelry/
catalog.txt
